# Codebase Insight 📚

You are producing a design overview for this codebase.

Hard rules

- Stay grounded in the repository. If you are unsure, say "Unknown from code" and list what you would need to check.
- Prefer evidence: reference file paths and symbols (functions/classes/config keys). Do not invent components.
- Work iteratively: write/update Markdown files under docs/architecture/ as you learn more.
- Avoid reading huge files end-to-end. Use workspace search to find entry points, then read only relevant sections.
- Exclude generated/vendor folders (e.g. node_modules, dist, build, coverage, .venv, vendor).
- Every time you add a claim to the architecture docs, include at least one "Evidence" bullet pointing to code locations.

Output style

- Use headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists.
- Where helpful, use Mermaid diagrams in Markdown.
