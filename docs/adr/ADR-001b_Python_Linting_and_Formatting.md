## Context 🧭

The Python tech stack needs a single, fast, consistent approach for linting and formatting that can run in CI and locally without heavy configuration.

## Decision ✅

### Assumptions 🧩

- Python 3.14.3 is the baseline runtime.
- Formatting must be deterministic and consistent across the codebase.
- Linting should catch correctness and style issues with low noise.

### Drivers 🎯

- One-tool workflow where possible
- Fast execution for local and CI use
- Deterministic formatting
- High signal linting
- Active maintenance and ecosystem support

### Options 🔀

#### Option A: Ruff (Selected) ✅

Use [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for both linting and formatting.

| Criteria               | Score/Notes                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Formatting consistency | ⭐⭐⭐ Built-in formatter       |
| Lint coverage          | ⭐⭐⭐ Broad checks in one tool |
| Performance            | ⭐⭐⭐ Very fast                |
| Configuration overhead | ⭐⭐ Simple unified config      |
| Ecosystem support      | ⭐⭐⭐ Strong and growing       |
| Effort                 | S                               |

#### Option B: Black + isort + Flake8

Use [`Black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort), and [`Flake8`](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) together.

| Criteria               | Score/Notes                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Formatting consistency | ⭐⭐⭐ Black is stable            |
| Lint coverage          | ⭐⭐ Needs multiple plugins       |
| Performance            | ⭐⭐ Multiple tools add overhead  |
| Configuration overhead | ⭐⭐ Many configs to keep in sync |
| Ecosystem support      | ⭐⭐⭐ Mature and stable          |
| Effort                 | M                                 |

**Why not chosen**: Good quality but slower and more complex than a single tool.

#### Option C: Pylint + Black

Use [`Pylint`](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint) for linting and Black for formatting.

| Criteria               | Score/Notes                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Formatting consistency | ⭐⭐⭐ Black is stable              |
| Lint coverage          | ⭐⭐⭐ Deep checks but can be noisy |
| Performance            | ⭐⭐ Slower on large codebases      |
| Configuration overhead | ⭐⭐ Significant tuning             |
| Ecosystem support      | ⭐⭐ Stable but heavier             |
| Effort                 | M                                   |

**Why not chosen**: Higher noise and slower than Ruff for the default stack.

#### Option D: autopep8 + pycodestyle

Use [`autopep8`](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) and [`pycodestyle`](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle).

| Criteria               | Score/Notes                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Formatting consistency | ⭐⭐ Less strict and less predictable |
| Lint coverage          | ⭐ Low, basic checks                  |
| Performance            | ⭐⭐⭐ Fast                           |
| Configuration overhead | ⭐⭐ Moderate                         |
| Ecosystem support      | ⭐⭐ Stable but older stack           |
| Effort                 | M                                     |

**Why not chosen**: Weaker lint coverage and less deterministic formatting.

#### Option E: YAPF + Flake8

Use [`YAPF`](https://github.com/google/yapf) with Flake8.

| Criteria               | Score/Notes                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Formatting consistency | ⭐⭐ Configurable but subjective |
| Lint coverage          | ⭐⭐ Depends on Flake8 plugins   |
| Performance            | ⭐⭐ Reasonable                  |
| Configuration overhead | ⭐⭐ More tuning required        |
| Ecosystem support      | ⭐⭐ Maintained but less common  |
| Effort                 | M                                |

**Why not chosen**: More configuration with no clear benefit over Ruff.

### Outcome 🏁

Adopt `ruff` for both linting and formatting. This decision is reversible if tooling changes or if ruff ceases to meet coverage needs.

### Rationale 🧠

Ruff provides a fast, single-tool workflow with strong lint coverage and a built-in formatter. It keeps the toolchain simple and consistent.

## Consequences ⚖️

- Projects should configure Ruff in `pyproject.toml`.
- Additional linters require explicit justification.

## Compliance 📏

- `uv run ruff format --check .` produces no changes.
- `uv run ruff check .` succeeds in CI.
