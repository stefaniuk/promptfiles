## Context 🧭

The Rust tech stack needs a default logging approach that supports structured logs, multi-sink output, and good local console readability.

## Decision ✅

### Assumptions 🧩

- Rust 1.93.0 is the baseline toolchain.
- Structured logs are required for services.
- Local developer output should remain readable.

### Drivers 🎯

- Structured logging support with JSON output
- Multi-sink management (JSON to file and readable console output)
- Pretty, coloured console output for local use
- Log levels and filtering support
- Performance suitable for services and CLIs
- Low dependency footprint
- Ecosystem support and longevity

Weighted criteria use a 1-5 scale (higher is more important). Scores use ⭐ (1), ⭐⭐ (2), ⭐⭐⭐ (3). Weighted totals exclude Effort and have a maximum of 69.

| Criteria                 | Weight | Rationale                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Structured logging       | 5      | Highest priority for consistency and observability |
| Multi-sink management    | 4      | Core requirement for JSON file plus console output |
| Console pretty/colour    | 4      | Developer experience for local runs                |
| Log levels and filtering | 4      | Needed for operational control                     |
| Performance              | 2      | Important but secondary                            |
| Dependency footprint     | 2      | Prefer lighter dependencies                        |
| Ecosystem support        | 2      | Adoption matters for longevity                     |

**Why not chosen**: Configuration-heavy compared with tracing.

#### Option E: fern

Use [`fern`](https://github.com/daboross/fern) for logging setup.

| Criteria                 | Score/Notes                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Structured logging       | ⭐⭐ Supports JSON with extra setup |
| Multi-sink management    | ⭐⭐ Supports chaining              |

| Weighted score (max 69)  | 52                                  |

**Why not chosen**: Requires more manual setup and has a smaller ecosystem.

### Outcome 🏁

Adopt `tracing` as the default logging library for Rust. This decision is reversible if ecosystem support shifts.

### Rationale 🧠

Using the weighted criteria, `tracing` scores highest because it provides structured logging with good fan-out support and modern ecosystem adoption.

## Consequences ⚖️

- Rust services should use tracing with JSON file output and console formatting.
- Alternative logging frameworks require explicit justification.

## Compliance 📏

- New services emit structured JSON logs with level and event fields.
- Multi-sink logging (file and console) is configured where required.
